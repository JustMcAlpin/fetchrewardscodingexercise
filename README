# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise

## Overview
This is my solution for the Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise.  
The app retrieves data from an API, filters out blank names, sorts the items by `listId`, and orders names numerically.

## Features
- Uses Retrofit to fetch data.
- Filters out items with empty or null names.
- Groups items by `listId` and sorts by name numerically.
- Displays data in a RecyclerView with section headers.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
3. Run the app on an **emulator or physical device**.
